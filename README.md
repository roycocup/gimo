## Gimo Test


## Usage
- Clone the repository https://github.com/roycocup/gimo
- run composer install 
- Set up your apache and point it to src/ folder (you know what a folder is dont you?)


## Notes
- This was done because the machine you provided had several problems:
    - Xammp is unable to start apache 
    - Its hard to know where the document root is
    - I dont know the machine and it has weird bugs
    - No one said I was not to use a cloud service
- Î¤he guy next to me is sick... so thank you for making catch a cold for the other interviews
- oh... I do know what json is. Thanks for the sarcastic remark on the test page. 
- Also, to make you remember what all your jobs were on the welcoming form and then
making you sign it so you are legally bound to the fact that the dates may differ... is just not nice.
